HW4:

In this assignment I experimented with time-series data using the qog dataset. 

I analyzed one relationship using different models, again examining female unemployment's relationship to birth rate. 

Models used:
1. Naive OLS
2. First-differenced OLS

Differencing is quite important because if your data has a lot of noise or isn't handled well by simpler models due to serial correlation or other factors, differencing the data helps bring out the underlying trend. 

I saw this when I ran the model because the naive OLS was not significant, but the differenced model was.
